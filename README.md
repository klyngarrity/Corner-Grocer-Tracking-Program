"# Corner-Grocer-Tracking-Program" 

This program creates a list of all items purchesed on a given day along with the number of times it was purchased. It can also produce a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased on a given day. And finally, it can produce a historgam showing the frquency in which each item was purchased.
I beleive I did all three aspects particularly well, I had no issues combining Python with the C++ code.
I could have enchanced the code further when it came to reading the frequncy.dat file. Had I more time, I would have implemented an error-check that if the wrong produce item was entered, the program would prompt for another item instead of exiting with an error code.
I remember I had some trouble writing the code that would save to the frequency.dat file. Initially, it was just writing a single produce item and it's frequency rather than the whole list. I was able to fix this with some help from the teacher and also stack overflow was very helpful.
Getting used to visual studio and setting it up so that it would also read Python Code all took time to learn. Now that I've done it several times it will make working with Visual Studio much easier in the future. I can also see myself combining Python again with C++ future projects as I like working with Python but I also enjoy C++'s speed. 
For enchanced readability, I always use proper white spacing, appropriate variable/method names, and comments are included for all methods explaining their purposes.
